Editorial Review 
Introducing computer programming to your children could be a challenge, especially for those who aren¡¯t familiar with the nuances of code.

How do you educate your children a software coding? 
It is a case that the first step into software & coding education is computing thinking.
Should I teach my child in elementary school programming(coding) language? 
It's very unlikely to close an answer. 

Computer programming(coding) is just a process of training.
The purpose of programming education is to nurture the basis for self-coding, or 'computational thinking building'.
